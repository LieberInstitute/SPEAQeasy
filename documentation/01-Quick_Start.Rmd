# Quick Start {#quick-start}

A brief guide to setting up SPEAQeasy. A more detailed and thorough guide is [here](#setup-details).

## Setup

1. Clone the SPEAQeasy repository with `git clone git@github.com:LieberInstitute/SPEAQeasy.git`
2. Change directory into the repository with `cd SPEAQeasy`
3. Users of the [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) cluster should run `bash install_software.sh "jhpce"`. All other users are recommended to run `bash install_software.sh "docker"` or `bash install_software.sh "singularity"`, to use either docker or singularity to manage software, respectively. This will install nextflow and set up some test files. Otherwise, you can install everything required locally with `bash install_software.sh "local"`.

**Note:** JHPCE users must also make an edit to their `~/.bashrc` files, described [here](#installation)

## Configuration {#quick-config}

### Your "main" script ###

The script you will use to run the pipeline depends on the system ("executor") you wish to run the pipeline on. 

| Executor | Script |
| -----  | ----------- |
| SGE cluster | run_pipeline_sge.sh |
| SLURM cluster | run_pipeline_slurm.sh |
| local machine | run_pipeline_local.sh |
| The [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) cluster | run_pipeline_jhpce.sh |

[Options included in the main script](#command-opts) should be modified as appropriate for the experiment. On SLURM and SGE clusters (including JHPCE), the main script should be submitted as a job (i.e. using `sbatch` or `qsub`). On local machines, the pipeline can be run interactively (i.e. `bash run_pipeline_local.sh`).


### Your config file ###

Your "executor" (SLURM cluster, SGE cluster, or local) determines the name of your config, regardless of how you choose to install SPEAQeasy. Find your file under `SPEAQeasy/conf/`.

| Executor | Config Filename |
| -----  | ----- |
| SGE cluster | sge.config |
| SLURM cluster | slurm.config |
| local machine | local.config |
| The [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) cluster | jhpce.config |
