# Overview {-}

SPEAQeasy is a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)-based **S**calable RNA-seq **P**ipeline for **E**xpression **A**nd **Q**uantification.

![](images/4_workflow.png)
*Diagram representing the "conceptual" workflow traversed by SPEAQeasy. Here some nextflow [`processes`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html) are grouped together for simplicity; the exact processes traversed are enumerated [here](#pipeline-overview). The red box indicates the FASTQ files are inputs to the pipeline; green coloring denotes major output files from the pipeline; the remaining boxes represent computational steps. Yellow-colored steps are optional or not always performed; for example, preparing a particular set of annotation files occurs once and uses a cache for further runs. Finally, blue-colored steps are ordinary processes which occur on every pipeline execution.*

## R session information {-}

Details on the R version used for making this book. The source code is available at [`LieberInstitute/SPEAQeasy`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/SPEAQeasy).

```{r session_info_chunk, eval = FALSE}
## Load the package at the top of your script
library("sessioninfo")

## Reproducibility information
print('Reproducibility information:')
Sys.time()
proc.time()
options(width = 120)
session_info()
```

```{r session_info, echo = FALSE}
<<session_info_chunk>>
```

This book was last updated on `r Sys.time()`.
